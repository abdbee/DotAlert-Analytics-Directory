Overall, for the moment the site gives me the impression of unfinished
I find that when you arrive on the site, the first links found on the home page are not very representative of the questions you can ask yourself as a beginner, nor as an advanced user.
maybe the sections about the platform and its missions should not be at the top

I would like to see more educational content, like advanced usage of polkadot.js for the chain state and extrinsics tabs for example, or explanations on how proxy accounts work
links to ""practical tools"" gathered in a section would also be a plus

for more basic users, mini tutorials on multichain operation and explanations on the different networks in an account with several addresses, could be a good idea

the home page could put together a few paragraphs on the strong points of Polkadot as an introduction for those who wish to have a quick overview of what it offers (layer0, parachains, XCM, crowdloans, governance...) and then give access to sub-contents that redirect to the main categories

concerning the name of the categories, I will rather see something a little more explicit, for example
acquisition and transfer
accounts and wallets
specific operations
social media

I'm not sure to see the usefulness of the last item ""regulation"" in the immediate future

A few other things I noticed:
the ""reviewing assets"" button on the homepage redirects to ""social-support"" that does not seem to me to be the right label
on the ""acquisition"" page I find it a shame to put the less common means first, most users will rather have a use on CEX/DEX a priori
on this same page, it is noted that one can acquire DOT on Karura, it is rather Acala
on the crowdloan page, I find it a shame to put examples of projects in illustration, rather than explanatory diagrams of the functioning of crowdloans

and to end on a positive note, I find that the articles are well written and very understandable, which is why I will be delighted to be able to use this platform more and redirect users who have questions on it if necessary :)

see you

but few people followed

I know one way that can attract a community

https://crew3.xyz/

On this page you can create tasks to solve, for example
give Follow, like under the post

EXP points are collected for tasks

And think about how to reward such top users

I'm posting an example project of what it looks like in others
